============
Transactions
============
While not inside a transaction, methods that modify the database write out the database to the disk before they return. This is good if you don't have a lot of requests, but if you are going to execute two or more statements that modify data in a row, you should execute them within a transaction. 

Opening a transaction
---------------------

Begin a transaction like this::

	db.BeginTransaction()

However, that will create a savepoint called "transaction". To begin a transaction without that, (you will be unable to revert the transaction) do this::

	db.BeginTransaction(False)

Committing a transaction
------------------------
To commit the transaction and write to the disk::

	db.CommitTransaction()

Reverting a transaction
-----------------------
If you chose to make a save, you can revert a transaction::

	db.RevertTransaction()

Checking if a transaction is in progress
----------------------------------------
You can always tell if a transaction is in progress with the boolean value ``db.TransactionInProgress``
