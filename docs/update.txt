Modifying data
==============
The ``Update`` method
---------------------

Update is a little bit more complicated. Here is an example to get you going::

    db.Update("Table name", db.Select("Table name", favColour = 0xffffff), UID = 12, Username = "test")

This is the same as the SQL statement::

    UPDATE `Table name` SET `UID` = 12, `Username` = 'test' WHERE `favColour` = 0xffffff;

Lambdas may be used in the select statement, but not the update statement. To achieve something similar, you can do this::

    for datapoint in db.Select("Table name", favColour = 0xffffff):
        db.Update("Table name", [datapoint], UID = datapoint["UID"] + 1)

That would increment the UIDs of every user with the favourite colour of white.

It can also be combined with the Dump method::

    db.Update("Table name", db.Dump("Table name"), username = "newusername")
	
That would change every user's username to "newusername"

Just as with inserts, you may use lists to update data.
