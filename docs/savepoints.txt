==========
Savepoints
==========
Creating
--------
Creating a savepoint is as easy as this::

    db.Save("Savepoint name")

Saving a specific table::

	db.Save("Savepoint name", "Table name")

Reverting
---------
Reverting back to a savepoint::

    db.Revert("Savepoint name")
	
Recovering a specific table from a savepoint::

    db.Revert("Savepoint name", "Table name")

If you only saved a few tables, only those tables will be recovered if you attempt to recover the entire save. Other tables will remain untouched

Removing
--------
Deleting a savepoint::

	db.RemoveSave("Savepoint name")

Listing savepoints
------------------
List your savepoints like this::

	db.ListSaves()

Verify a savepoint exists like this::

	db.SaveExists("name")

Manual editing of savepoints
----------------------------

You can manually retrieve or insert a savepoint with these methods::

    db.GetSave("Savepoint name")
    db.GetSave()
    db.PutSave(data,"Savepoint name")
    db.PutSave(data)
	
Under most circumstances, you should never need to use those methods. If for some reason you do, DO NOT confuse whether you are putting a save requested with a savepoint name or without one.
